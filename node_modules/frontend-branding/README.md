Typical usage in a weback configuration:

<pre>
let brandingDiscovery = require('frontend-branding/branding-discovery.js');
....
(webpack config)
    plugins: [
        ...
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({
            ...
            BRANDINGS: brandingDiscovery(),
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
</pre>

See injectapp.js in fortnox-react where the global BRANDINGS is used.
